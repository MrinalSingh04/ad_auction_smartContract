# Decentralized Ad Auction Smart Contract

## üìå Overview

The **Decentralized Ad Auction Smart Contract** allows advertisers to bid in **ETH** for an on-chain **ad slot**. The highest bidder gets their ad displayed, and if someone outbids them, the previous advertiser receives a refund. The ad remains active for a fixed duration, after which it can be reset for new bids.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

‚úÖ **On-Chain Ad Auction** ‚Äì Highest bidder wins the ad slot.

‚úÖ **Time-Based Ownership** ‚Äì Ads expire after a set duration (default: 24 hours).

‚úÖ **Refund System** ‚Äì When a new bidder outbids the current advertiser, the previous bidder gets refunded.

‚úÖ **Multiple Ad Slots** ‚Äì Supports multiple ad slots, each managed separately.

‚úÖ **Admin Withdrawals** ‚Äì The contract owner can withdraw collected ETH.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Advertisers Bid** ‚Äì Calls `bidForAd(slotId, adContent)` with ETH to place a bid.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **If Outbid** ‚Äì The previous highest bidder is refunded their ETH.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Ad Remains Active** ‚Äì The winning ad stays live for the defined duration (`auctionDuration`).

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Ad Expiry** ‚Äì When time expires, `expireAd(slotId)` can be called to reset the slot.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Owner Withdraws** ‚Äì The contract owner can withdraw collected ETH via `withdraw()`.

## üì¶ Installation & Deployment

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Dependencies** (Optional for testing)

If you're using **Hardhat** or **Remix**, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install hardhat ethers dotenv
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Compile the Contract**

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy on Ethereum Testnet**

Modify the deploy script and deploy using Hardhat:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

For **Remix**, simply paste the code and deploy using **Injected Web3 (MetaMask)**.
